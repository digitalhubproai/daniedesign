    services: ["Brand Strategy", "Visual Identity", "Packaging"],
    featured: true,
    challenge:
      "Ember was a beloved local roaster with strong coffee and an inconsistent visual presence. As retail orders grew, the brand needed to look as refined as the product — without losing the warmth regulars recognized.",
    approach:
      "We started with positioning workshops and a competitive audit, then distilled the brand into a single idea: fire, patience and craft. Everything — from the logotype to the roast labels — was built around that idea.",
    design:
      "The identity pairs a bold wordmark with a flexible flame motif that scales from a 4mm coffee bag stamp to a storefront sign. A warm, earthy palette and two display typefaces give the brand editorial confidence.",
    development:
      "We built the packaging system as a modular grid, so new roast launches reuse the same structure without a redesign. A Webflow storefront carries the identity through to the checkout experience.",
    outcome:
      "Within eight months, Ember secured placement in 60+ retail locations and reported a 45% lift in direct-to-consumer sales attributed to the rebrand.",

    services: ["UX Research", "Product Design", "Design System"],
    featured: true,
    challenge:
      "Northline's analytics product was powerful but dense. New customers regularly abandoned setup within the first session, and the support team was buried in questions about basic configuration.",
    approach:
      "We ran 18 user interviews, mapped the activation funnel, and rebuilt the product around three job-to-be-done flows instead of a feature list. Every screen was tested in high-fidelity prototypes before development.",
    design:
      "The interface uses a calm, data-dense visual language: large typography for answers, quiet charts, and one accent color reserved for actions. A living design system keeps the team consistent at speed.",
    development:
      "We handed off a React component library with full states, responsive behavior and accessibility notes, then supported the engineering team through two release cycles.",
    outcome:
      "Onboarding completion rose from 34% to 81%, and the support queue around setup dropped by roughly two-thirds within a quarter.",

    featured: true,
    challenge:
      "Vanta needed to make budgeting feel effortless for people who had never stuck with a finance app. The founding team wanted a product that felt more like a calm daily habit than a spreadsheet.",
    approach:
      "We researched habits around money anxiety, then prototyped a frictionless 'check-in' model: five seconds of interaction per day, with the app doing the heavy analysis in the background.",
    design:
      "The interface leans on generous spacing, soft motion and plain-language copy. A dark-first palette reduces the 'dashboard dread' users reported with competitors.",
    development:
      "Built in Flutter for iOS and Android with a shared codebase, including biometric onboarding, offline transactions and a widget system for glanceable balances.",
    outcome:
      "200k+ installs in year one, a 4.7-star average rating, and a retention curve that beat the category benchmark at every interval.",

    services: ["Website Design", "Web Development", "Art Direction"],
    featured: true,
    challenge:
      "Lumen's previous site buried its most striking projects under a conventional gallery grid. The practice wanted the website to feel like walking through a well-edited monograph.",
    approach:
      "We structured the site around the project, not the page: full-bleed imagery, generous whitespace and a reading rhythm that slows the visitor down deliberately.",
    design:
      "A near-monochrome system with one accent signals interactive moments. Custom type sizing and careful line length make even dense technical text feel editorial.",
    development:
      "Built on a React front end with a headless CMS, featuring predictive project navigation, lazy-loaded high-resolution imagery and 95+ performance scores across devices.",
    outcome:
      "The site doubled average session time and became the practice's primary source of new inquiries within six months of launch.",

    services: ["SEO", "Content Strategy", "Paid Media"],
    challenge:
      "Meridian had a strong product and almost no organic presence. Search demand existed but competitors owned every head term, and paid acquisition costs were climbing each quarter.",
    approach:
      "We rebuilt their content around shopping intent, launched a technical SEO cleanup, and unified paid social with a single creative system built from the brand identity.",
    design:
      "Campaign creative used the brand's fresh, food-led photography system with short, honest copy — a deliberate contrast to the discount-heavy tone of the category.",
    development:
      "A headless landing-page system let the marketing team launch new campaigns in hours instead of weeks, with built-in A/B testing and analytics hooks.",
    outcome:
      "Organic revenue tripled within nine months, while blended acquisition costs fell 38% over the same period.",

    services: ["Brand Identity", "Art Direction", "Social Media Design"],
    challenge:
      "Sable's products were beautiful; its brand was invisible. Wholesale buyers couldn't remember the studio, and social feeds looked like a different brand every week.",
    approach:
      "We built the identity from the material itself — glaze, clay and kiln marks — translating the maker's process into a flexible visual language.",
    design:
      "The system pairs a quiet serif for storytelling with a functional sans for commerce, over a warm, clay-toned palette. Pattern motifs echo the studio's signature glaze textures.",
    development:
      "A complete guidelines package, wholesale sell-sheet templates and social grid system made the brand easy for the small team to run consistently.",
    outcome:
      "Sable grew from 12 to 40+ wholesale accounts in a year and doubled its social audience without paid promotion.",

      "Arc Legal's site looked credible but converted poorly — visitors couldn't tell which practice areas the firm actually led in, and the contact path was buried.",
    approach:
      "We rebuilt the information architecture around practice depth rather than firm history, then engineered every page toward a single, obvious next step.",
    design:
      "A restrained, trustworthy visual system with strong typography and courtroom photography. Trust signals — verdicts, credentials, recognitions — appear consistently near decision points.",
    development:
      "Webflow build with a CMS for case studies, strict technical SEO, and an integrated form pipeline with CRM routing and team notifications.",
